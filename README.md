# Pinterest Clone: Create and Organize Boards with Pins

This project is a Pinterest clone that allows users to create boards and save pins to those boards. Similar pins are displayed below each pin on the pin-detail page. The underlying algorithm is straightforward: when a user visits the pin-detail page, the system searches the database for all boards that may contain that particular pin and then displays all the pins within those boards.

## Features

- **Public profile**: Users can have a public profile that includes a bio, photo, website link, and more.
- **Pin creation**: Users can create pins with images or videos.
- **Board creation**: Users can create boards, both public and private (only visible to the user).
- **Board management**: Users can edit the board cover, name, and other details.
- **Pin management**: Users can edit a pin's board, title, description, or delete it.
- **Follow/unfollow**: Users can follow or unfollow other users.
- **Commenting**: Users can add comments to pins.
- **Pin saving**: Users can save pins to their own boards.
- And more...
